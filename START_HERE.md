| ---------------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **README.md**          | Complete tutorial & reference | Learning how everything works |
| **QUICK_REFERENCE.md** | Code snippets cheat sheet     | Quick lookup while coding     |
| **EXAMPLES.md**        | 8 ready-to-use scripts        | Copy-paste solutions          |
| **capture_image.py**   | Working capture script        | Run it now to test camera     |

## üöÄ Getting Started (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Test Your Setup

Run the working script to verify everything works:

```powershell
python capture_image.py
```

**Expected Result:** Two images saved in `captured_images` folder (JPEG and BMP)

### Step 2: Understand What Happened

Open `capture_image.py` and read through it. The main steps are:

1. **Initialize** camera ‚Üí Get a handle
2. **Calculate** buffer size ‚Üí Based on image dimensions
3. **Create** buffer ‚Üí To hold raw image data
4. **Start** streaming ‚Üí Camera begins capturing
5. **Get** frame ‚Üí Capture one image
6. **Stop** streaming ‚Üí Done capturing
7. **Format** image ‚Üí Convert to JPEG/BMP
8. **Save** to file ‚Üí Write to disk
9. **Cleanup** ‚Üí Uninitialize camera

### Step 3: Try the Examples

Pick any example from `EXAMPLES.md` and try it:

- **Example 1**: Simplest possible capture (10 lines)
- **Example 4**: Time-lapse photography (cool!)
- **Example 6**: See live frame rate

## üí° Tips for Success

### 1. Start Small

Don't try to learn everything at once. Run Example 1, understand it, then move on.

### 2. Experiment Safely

The camera won't break from code! Try different settings and see what happens.

### 3. Read Error Messages

They're actually helpful! If you get an error:

1. Read the error message
2. Check Troubleshooting in README.md
3. Make sure camera is connected and not in use

### 4. Use the Samples

The SDK includes official samples in:
`pixelinkPythonWrapper-master\samples\Windows\`

### 5. Keep Documentation Open

While coding, keep these tabs open:

- QUICK_REFERENCE.md (for syntax)
- Your Python file (what you're writing)
- Example in EXAMPLES.md (for reference)

### 6. Save Your Work

When you get something working, save the settings:

```python
PxLApi.saveSettings(hCamera, "my_config.pfs")
```

## üéì Understanding Core Concepts

### The Camera Handle

```python
ret = PxLApi.initialize(0)
hCamera = ret[1]  # This is your "connection" to the camera
```

Everything you do uses this handle. Don't lose it!

### Return Values

Every function returns a tuple:

```python
ret = PxLApi.someFunction(hCamera)
# ret[0] = return code (success or error)
# ret[1] = data (if successful)
```

Always check: `if PxLApi.apiSuccess(ret[0]):`

### The Buffer

Raw images need somewhere to live:

```python
from ctypes import create_string_buffer
rawImage = create_string_buffer(buffer_size)
```

This is like a container for the image data.

### Streaming

Camera must be streaming to capture:

```python
PxLApi.setStreamState(hCamera, PxLApi.StreamState.START)
# ... capture images ...
PxLApi.setStreamState(hCamera, PxLApi.StreamState.STOP)
```

### Features

Everything adjustable is a "feature":

- Exposure ‚Üí `PxLApi.FeatureId.EXPOSURE`
- Gain ‚Üí `PxLApi.FeatureId.GAIN`
- ROI ‚Üí `PxLApi.FeatureId.ROI`

Get them: `PxLApi.getFeature(hCamera, feature_id)`  
Set them: `PxLApi.setFeature(hCamera, feature_id, flags, params)`

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Workflow

### Typical Session

1. **Test camera works**

   ```powershell
   python capture_image.py
   ```

2. **Find example close to what you need**

   - Look in EXAMPLES.md
   - Copy the code

3. **Modify for your needs**

   - Change file names
   - Adjust settings
   - Add your logic

4. **Test incrementally**

   - Run after each small change
   - Check for errors
   - Verify output

5. **Save good settings**
   - When you get good image quality
   - `PxLApi.saveSettings(...)`

## üìû When You Need Help

### Self-Help Checklist

- [ ] Did you check Troubleshooting in README.md?
- [ ] Did you read the error message carefully?
- [ ] Is the camera connected and working?
- [ ] Did you try the exact example from EXAMPLES.md?
- [ ] Did you search this document for keywords?
