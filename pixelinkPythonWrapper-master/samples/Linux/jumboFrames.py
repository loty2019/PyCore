jumboFrames.py

A demonstration of how to enable jumbo frames for a Gigabit Ethernet camera.

NOTE:
- All GigE cameras initialized after jumbo frames are enabled will use jumbo frames.
- All GigE cameras initialized after jumbo frames are disabled will not use jumbo frames.
- Support for jumbo frames is limited to the life of the application. i.e. You must enable it
  each time your program runs.
- Support for jumbo frames is limited to the life of the application enabling jumbo frames. i.e. If you have
  another program talking to a Pixelink GigE camera, that application must itself enable jumbo frames.
BE AWARE:
- The IEEE 802 standards committee does not official recognize jumbo frames.

- By "enabling" jumbo frames here, the Pixelink library is simply being asked to use jumbo frames. Your 
  network interface card (NIC) must not only support jumbo frames, but must also have jumbo frames enabled.

- NICs that do support jumbo frames typically default to jumbo frame support DISABLED. Please consult the 
  documentation for your NIC.

- All devices (routers, switches etc.) between the host NIC and the GigE camera must support and have 
  jumbo frames enabled.
