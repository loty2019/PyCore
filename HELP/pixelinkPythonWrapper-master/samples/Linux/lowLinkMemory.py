lowUsbMemory.py

Demonstrates how to detect / deal with systems configured with a small amount of link
(USB or NetworkStack) memory.

As per the INSTALL.INSTRUCTIONS.txt file that accompanies the Pixelink SDK, by default, 
many Linux systems may not be configured with enough link buffer memory to permit optimal 
streaming for a high performance camera, such as many models of the Pixelink cameras. 
This same TXT file offers advice on how you may reconfigure your system to allocate more 
link buffer memory.

However, should you choose not to re-configure your system, you can use the Pixelink Python 
wrapper function 'PxLApi.setStreamState' to determine if your system's link memory requirements 
are less than optimal. In particular, if the PxLApi.setStreamState returns a response code of 
'PxLApi.ReturnCode.ApiSucessLowMemory' when you attempt a PxLApi.StreamState.START or 
PxLApi.StreamState.PAUSE operation, then the Pixelink API has detected that your systems link 
memory allocation is sub-optimal. The Pixelink API has made some internal 'concessions' to 
accomodate. These concesions MAY result in some frame loss when the camera is streaming. More
on this below.

So, what should your application do when PxLApi.setStreamState returns 
'PxLApi.ReturnCode.ApiSuccessLowMemory'??
There are several otions:
 1. Do nothing.
       Meaning, the Pixelink API has already made some internal concessions to deal with 
       the sub-optimal link buffer space. If while streaming, your camera continually flashes 
       its LED green -- then no frame loss occuring. However, if you see a periodic red flash 
       from the camera, then you are experiencing some frame loss that is probably the result
       of these concessions. In which case, you may want to consider one of the other options.
 2. Use a 8-bit pixel format (if you're not already).
       The 12 and 16-bit pixel formats (MONO16, MONO12_PACKED, and BAYER16)
       produce larger images that require more link buffer memory
 3. Reduce the region of interest (ROI) to reduce image size.
 4. Use Pixel Addressing to reduce image size.
 5. Reduce the frame rate.

This sample, uses strategy #5 from above.
