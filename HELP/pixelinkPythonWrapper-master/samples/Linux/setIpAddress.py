setIpAddress.py 

This demonstration application assumes that you have one GigE camera visible to the host, and that
that GigE camera is connected to a GigE card with a statically assigned IP address.

This demo app is incomplete in that we can't know a priori what IP address, subnet mask and 
gateway *YOU* need to set. If you're unsure what values these need to be, please consult 
your local network administrator/administratrix.
